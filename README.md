### Description

Made for **raylib NEXT gamejam**.

Master and student unite in this magical action game. Cast spells in sync with your apprentice to defeat waves of enemies, proving that two wizards are stronger than one.

> This is my first gamejam submission and the first *kinda* completed game ever. The in-game ui is bad, there are no collisions and there are only 2 spells. However, I really liked the process of creating a game and I'm looking forward to polish it after the winners are decided.

### Features

 - Cast spells in tandem to defeat endless hordes of enemies.
